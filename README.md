# JavaHandsOn: Data Structures, Design Patterns, and Algorithms

## Overview

Welcome to JavaHandsOn! This repository captures my journey of learning and practicing data structures, design patterns, and algorithms using Java. I've covered a variety of topics, including specific data structures, design patterns, and essential algorithms.

## Topics Covered

### Data Structures

- **HashMap:** Understanding key-value mappings and efficient data retrieval.
- **HashSet:** Exploring the implementation of sets for unique elements.
- **Linked List:** Grasping the concepts of linked data structures.
- **Queue:** Learning about first-in-first-out data structures.
- **Stack:** Exploring last-in-first-out data structures.

### Design Patterns

- **Facade Pattern:** Simplifying complex systems by providing a unified interface.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensuring a class has only one instance and providing a global point of access to it.

### Algorithms

- **Binary Search:** Efficiently searching for an element in a sorted collection.
- **Recursion:** Solving problems by breaking them into smaller, similar subproblems.
- **Sliding Window:** Optimizing array or list processing using a 'window' of elements.
- **Two Pointer:** Using two pointers to traverse a data structure or search for a solution.
- **Greedy Algorithm:** Making locally optimal choices at each stage to achieve a global optimum.
- **Frequency Count:** Analyzing the frequency of elements in a dataset.
- **Backtracking:** Systematically searching for a solution to a problem.

## Project Structure

- **src/ :** Contains Java source code for implementing and demonstrating covered topics.
